# CapstoneProject
#Girl talk is a program that I would like to build within Memphis Shelby County Schools. This program will be beneficial for MSCS schools because this platform will bring teens together by creating a safe space to discuss with other students or guidance counselors. There will be daily discussions on everyday problems. Students will also be able to share success stories and accomplishments. Guidance Counselors and therapists will be available if students would like to attend therapy sessions. This program is intended to bring the community together. Young ladies will come across a lot of insecurities within themselves as they get older, and some will feel as if they are alone. Girl Talk will help show that they are not alone, and there is a community that has your back. Girl Talk will be available for girls entering the 5th grade, and all women guidance counselors and therapists will have access to this website by using their email address. The biggest question you may be wondering is how to keep things positive. I think that will be the biggest issue, but I feel if we apply school rules and certain disciplinary actions, this program will be a success. All open conversations on the discussion board will be monitored.
